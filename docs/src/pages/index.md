# Susi

Susi (SUsi is not SnIps) is a replacement for the Snips
home assistant ecosystem. It follows mainly the same architecture as
Snips (with a MQTT broker as central unit and MQTT messages exchanged
between the components).
Consequently most native Snips skills will run with Susi as well but without
the need of the (no longer available Snips console).
