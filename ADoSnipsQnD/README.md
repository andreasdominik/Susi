# ADoSnipsQnD

This is a really "Quick-and-Dirty" implementation of an Julia-ecosystem for the
Snips.ai home assistant.

Aim is not yet a production system but testing ways to develop apps in the new and awesome programming
language Julia.


## Installation

#### Dependencies:
The package builds on the mosquitto MQTT (`mosquitto_pub` and `mosquitto_sub`), which can be installed from the debian repos
(for Raspberry Pi: package `mosquitto` and `mosquitto-client`).

#### Julia
For the installation of the Julia language, refer to https://julialang.org/.

#### The QnD framework
The framework is installed as a Snips App.
Install the App `SnipsHermesQnD` in the Snips console.


## Documentation

Up-to-date documentation is in the source code.
The full documentation is just work-in-progress!

# Julia

This skill is (like the entire SnipsHermesQnD framework) written in the
modern programming language Julia (because Julia is faster
then Python and coding is much much easier and much more straight forward).
However "Pythonians" often need some time to get familiar with Julia.
